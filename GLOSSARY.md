# Glossary of SQL Terms

---

### A

*   **ACID**: An acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are the four properties of a database transaction that guarantee data validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.

### C

*   **Column**: A vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
*   **CTE (Common Table Expression)**: A temporary, named result set that you can reference within a `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. Created using the `WITH` clause.

### F

*   **Foreign Key**: A key used to link two tables together. It is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the `PRIMARY KEY` in another table.

### I

*   **Index**: A special lookup table that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval. An index is a pointer to data in a table.

### J

*   **JOIN**: An SQL clause used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

### P

*   **Primary Key**: A constraint that uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values.

### R

*   **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**: A program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. SQL is the language used to communicate with an RDBMS.
*   **Row**: A single, implicitly structured data item in a table. Also known as a record.

### S

*   **SQL (Structured Query Language)**: A domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

### T

*   **Table**: A set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns (identifiable by name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
*   **Transaction**: A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work.

### W

*   **Window Function**: A function which uses values from one or multiple rows to return a value for each row. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not group rows into a single output row.
