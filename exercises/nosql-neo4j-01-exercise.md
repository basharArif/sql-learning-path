# Neo4j Graph Database Exercise

**Level:** Intermediate  
**Time Estimate:** 30 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Neo4j fundamentals, Cypher queries, graph modeling.

## Exercise: Social Network Analysis

### Scenario
Design a Neo4j graph database for a professional networking platform with:
- User profiles and connections
- Company affiliations
- Skill endorsements
- Content sharing and interactions
- Recommendation algorithms

### Tasks

1. **Graph Schema Design**
   - Design node labels and properties
   - Define relationship types and properties
   - Plan for efficient traversal patterns

2. **Data Population**
   - Create sample users, companies, and skills
   - Establish connections and relationships
   - Add content and interaction data

3. **Query Implementation**
   - Find mutual connections between users
   - Discover skill clusters and expertise areas
   - Calculate influence scores
   - Generate content recommendations

4. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Implement PageRank algorithm
   - Find communities and clusters
   - Detect influential users
   - Generate network insights

### Sample Cypher Queries
```cypher
// Find mutual connections
MATCH (u1:User {name: "Alice"})-[:CONNECTED_TO]-(mutual:User)-[:CONNECTED_TO]-(u2:User {name: "Bob"})
WHERE u1 <> u2
RETURN mutual.name

// Calculate influence score
MATCH (u:User)-[:CONNECTED_TO]-(connected:User)
RETURN u.name, count(connected) as influence_score
ORDER BY influence_score DESC

// Find skill clusters
MATCH (s:Skill)-[:RELATED_TO]-(related:Skill)
RETURN s.name, collect(related.name) as related_skills
```

### Advanced Challenges
1. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest new connections based on mutual interests
2. **Content Viral Analysis**: Track how content spreads through the network
3. **Fraud Detection**: Identify suspicious connection patterns

## Learning Objectives
- Design effective graph schemas
- Write complex Cypher queries
- Implement graph algorithms
- Build recommendation systems
- Analyze network patterns and communities
