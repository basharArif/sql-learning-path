## üéØ Learning Approach

### For Each Database, Learn:
1. **Installation & Setup**: Local development environment
2. **Basic Operations**: CRUD operations in the database's native language
3. **Query Patterns**: How to retrieve and manipulate data
4. **Indexing**: Performance optimization techniques
5. **Advanced Features**: Unique capabilities of each database
6. **Best Practices**: Production-ready patterns and anti-patterns

### Recommended Learning Order:
1. **Start with MongoDB** (document databases - most approachable)
2. **Redis** (key-value stores - simple but powerful)
3. **Cassandra** (column-family - distributed systems concepts)
4. **Neo4j** (graph databases - different data model)
5. **Specialized databases** based on your needs
