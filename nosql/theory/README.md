# NoSQL Theory

This folder contains theoretical concepts that explain how NoSQL databases work at a deeper level. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing effective NoSQL solutions and making informed architectural decisions.

## ðŸ“š Modules

### [1.5-acid-vs-base-consistency.md](1.5-acid-vs-base-consistency.md)
**Level:** Intermediate | **Time:** 20 minutes

Explore the two primary consistency models in database systems. Covers:
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
- BASE characteristics (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency)
- Detailed comparison with practical examples
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Performance and scaling implications

### [1.7-nosql-data-modeling.md](1.7-nosql-data-modeling.md)
**Level:** Intermediate | **Time:** 30 minutes

Learn how to design schemas for NoSQL databases. Covers:
- Access pattern driven design (vs traditional normalization)
- Embedding vs referencing strategies
- Schema design patterns for different NoSQL types
- Common anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance optimization techniques
- Migration strategies from SQL to NoSQL

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

1. **Consistency First**: Understand ACID vs BASE to grasp data consistency trade-offs
2. **Modeling Patterns**: Learn how to design NoSQL schemas effectively
3. **Apply Concepts**: Use these patterns when working with specific databases

## ðŸ“– Prerequisites

- Completion of [fundamentals](../fundamentals/) modules
- Understanding of basic database concepts
- Familiarity with CAP theorem

## ðŸ”— Integration Points

These theoretical concepts directly apply to:
- **Database Implementation**: Understanding why certain databases behave differently
- **Schema Design**: Applying modeling patterns to real databases
- **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing between consistency models for different use cases

## ðŸ’¡ Key Concepts

- **ACID**: Strong consistency, traditional relational databases
- **BASE**: High availability, eventual consistency, most NoSQL databases
- **Data Modeling**: Design for query patterns, not just storage
- **Embedding**: Store related data together for fast access
- **Referencing**: Use pointers for relationships, avoid data duplication

## ðŸš€ Practical Application

Use these concepts when:
- Designing schemas for new NoSQL applications
- Migrating from SQL to NoSQL databases
- Troubleshooting consistency issues
- Optimizing performance in distributed systems

## ðŸ”— Next Steps

After mastering these concepts:
- Explore [specific database implementations](../databases/)
- Study [advanced scaling topics](../advanced/)
- Work on [practical applications](../practical/)
