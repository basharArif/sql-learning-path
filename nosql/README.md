# Non-Relational Databases Learning Path

This section covers NoSQL and non-relational database systems, complementing the relational SQL learning path. Unlike the RDBMS section that focuses on SQL concepts rather than specific implementations, this section covers the core concepts of different NoSQL database types.

## ðŸ“š Module Overview

### Foundational Concepts
- **[NoSQL vs SQL Comparison](fundamentals/0-nosql-vs-sql-comparison.md)**: When to choose each approach
- **[CAP Theorem and Trade-offs](fundamentals/1-cap-theorem-and-tradeoffs.md)**: Distributed systems fundamentals
- **[Document Databases](fundamentals/2-document-databases.md)**: Flexible schema, JSON-like documents
- **[Key-Value Stores](fundamentals/3-key-value-stores.md)**: Fast key-based access, caching
- **[Column-Family Stores](fundamentals/4-column-family-stores.md)**: Wide-column storage, analytics
- **[Graph Databases](fundamentals/5-graph-databases.md)**: Relationship-focused data models

### Theory
- **[ACID vs BASE Consistency](theory/1.5-acid-vs-base-consistency.md)**: Consistency models explained
- **[NoSQL Data Modeling](theory/1.7-nosql-data-modeling.md)**: Schema design patterns
- **[NoSQL Data Modeling Patterns](theory/2-nosql-data-modeling-patterns.md)**: Advanced modeling approaches

### Practical Applications
- **[NoSQL Performance and Optimization](practical/1-nosql-performance-optimization.md)**: Performance tuning strategies
- **[NoSQL Operations Best Practices](practical/2-nosql-operations-best-practices.md)**: Production operations

### Operations
- **Data Security**: NoSQL security best practices
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Tracking NoSQL database health
- **Backup and Recovery**: Data protection strategies

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

- Understand CAP theorem and database trade-offs
- Learn different data models (document, key-value, graph, etc.)
- Design schemas for non-relational systems
- Implement data modeling patterns for different use cases
- Optimize performance for specific database types
- Apply operational best practices in production environments

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Start with [NoSQL vs SQL Comparison](fundamentals/0-nosql-vs-sql-comparison.md) to understand when to choose each approach
2. Review [CAP theorem concepts](fundamentals/1-cap-theorem-and-tradeoffs.md) for distributed systems fundamentals
3. Study different [NoSQL data models](fundamentals/2-document-databases.md) starting with document databases
4. Learn about [consistency models](theory/1.5-acid-vs-base-consistency.md) (ACID vs BASE)
5. Study [data modeling patterns](theory/2-nosql-data-modeling-patterns.md) for NoSQL schema design
6. Practice with performance optimization techniques
7. Learn about operational considerations for production systems

## ðŸ“– Prerequisites

- Understanding of basic database concepts
- Familiarity with distributed systems concepts
- Basic command line usage

## ðŸ”„ Integration with SQL Learning

This NoSQL section complements the relational database learning path. Many applications use both SQL and NoSQL databases together (polyglot persistence).

- SQL for: Complex queries, transactions, structured data
- NoSQL for: Flexible schemas, high scalability, specific data patterns
