# Advanced NoSQL Topics

This folder will contain advanced concepts for scaling, optimizing, and managing NoSQL databases in production environments. These modules build upon the foundational and database-specific knowledge.

## ðŸ“š Planned Modules

### Performance & Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling Techniques**: Sharding, replication, clustering
- **Performance Optimization**: Query tuning, indexing strategies, caching
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Metrics, alerting, troubleshooting
- **Load Balancing**: Distribution strategies, failover mechanisms

### Security & Compliance
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Access control patterns
- **Encryption**: Data at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging**: Compliance and security monitoring
- **Network Security**: Firewall configuration, VPN setup

### Operations & Maintenance
- **Backup & Recovery**: Strategies for different database types
- **Disaster Recovery**: High availability and failover planning
- **Version Upgrades**: Migration strategies and compatibility
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource allocation and growth management

### Multi-Database Architectures
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Using multiple databases together
- **Data Synchronization**: Keeping databases in sync
- **CQRS Patterns**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Event Sourcing**: Event-driven architectures

## ðŸŽ¯ Target Audience

- Developers working with NoSQL in production
- Architects designing scalable systems
- DevOps engineers managing NoSQL infrastructure
- Anyone needing advanced NoSQL knowledge

## ðŸ“– Prerequisites

- Completion of all [fundamentals](../fundamentals/) and [theory](../theory/) modules
- Hands-on experience with at least 2-3 specific [databases](../databases/)
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts

## ðŸš€ Learning Outcomes

After completing these modules, you'll be able to:
- Design highly scalable NoSQL architectures
- Optimize performance for high-throughput applications
- Implement robust security and compliance measures
- Manage production NoSQL deployments
- Architect complex systems using multiple database types

## ðŸ’¡ Advanced Concepts Covered

- **Distributed Consensus**: Raft, Paxos algorithms
- **Eventual Consistency**: Conflict resolution strategies
- **CAP Theorem Trade-offs**: Real-world implementation decisions
- **Data Partitioning**: Sharding and data distribution
- **Replication Strategies**: Master-slave, multi-master, quorum-based

## ðŸ”— Integration with Practical Applications

These advanced topics directly support the [practical applications](../practical/) by providing the deep technical knowledge needed for real-world implementation.
